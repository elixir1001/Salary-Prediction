# StackOverFlow Developer Survey Data Analysis

Link to the dataset: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

Here I am using above dataset to analyze the results of developer survey conducted by StackOverFlow, and create a Machine Learning Model to predict Salary of Software Developers.

1. I cleaned the data with pandas and numpy, code can be found in Jupyter Notebook
2. I tested 3 Machine Learning Models
3. I created a Streamlit Webpage with 2 pages:- one to explore the data and other to use the Machine Learning Model to predict salary of software developer given Country, Education, and Experience.
